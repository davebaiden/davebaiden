## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ David here! | Junior Developer | Learner

### ðŸš€ About Me

I'm currently learning **full-stack software engineering** at ALX, where I combine hands-on practice with problem-solving to build scalable and impactful solutions.

As a **kinesthetic learner**, I understand best when I can **build**, **test**, and **interact** with the code. Thatâ€™s exactly why I chose this path â€” I love turning abstract ideas into working applications.

ðŸ’¡ **What inspires me?**  
The ability to create something from nothing. I believe technology is the tool that can change lives â€” and I want to be one of the people driving that change.

ðŸŒ± **Currently Learning:**  
- Front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)  
- Back-end (Python, Flask, Node.js)  
- Git, GitHub, APIs, Databases  

ðŸŽ¯ **Iâ€™m looking to work on:**  
<!-- Replace below with what excites you -->
- Web apps that solve real-world problems  
- Tools that make tech accessible in underserved communities  
- AI-assisted learning platforms  
- Scalable open-source projects that help others learn
